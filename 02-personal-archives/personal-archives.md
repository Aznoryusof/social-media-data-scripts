# Personal Archives

Our digital data archives come in all shapes and forms from timelines to message threads and comments. For most consumers, the formats provided by platforms are sufficient: users can browse their twitter history on an interactive timeline or click from message thread to message thread on the HTML pages from Facebook provides.

The scripts in this directory allow you to scrape parts of your personal Facebook archive.
